Our past few seasons of the FTC division of FIRST has been very eventful and successful. During the 2014-15 Cascade Effect season, we were part of the finalist alliance at the Saratoga QT and managed to advance to the NorCal championships from the Brentwood QT, where we had a very good run but did not qualify. This 2015-16 Res-Q season has been very successful, with an Inspire award win and NorCal championship advancement at our first tournament.

This is my second year in FTC, but I have taken part in several other competitions, such as Tech Challenge, FLL, and DI. I am also a part of the BSA and ESY. Robotics gives me a channel to express my creative side and merge this with analytical thinking. Very few programs can offer this rare combination. While in the past I have focused mostly towards hardware, this year I tried to assume more of a mentor role, facilitating discussion between the “babies” and guiding them. Last year in FTC, our team was defeated at regionals. This season, I hope our team can persevere and make it to Supers! I also enjoy Australian cinema.</p>

When I joined the team for the 2014-15 season, I had zero robotics knowledge. Using robotics as a means to stray from the artistic path I had limited myself to previously, I fell in love with the robotics environment and learned so much over the course of the season. The immense joy and satisfaction brought to me by robotics was what motivated me to apply to lead the team this year. I continue to participate in robotics in the hopes that I can bring the new roboticists the same knowledge and experiences my captains brought me.</p>

I am different than everyone else because I have innovative ideas that are implemented into the robot.</p>

                <p class="personBio">Hi! My name is Elliot van Huijgevoort and I am a member of the FTC robotics team, 4950. To start off, let me talk about who I am. I am 14 years old, turning 15 next year on June 25th. For school, I go to Cupertino High School. I am in robotics because I have always loved creating something incredible with others, and I now know that this is what we do in robotics every time we meet. Some experience I have is I am great at working in groups. This sometimes gets hard though, since it is difficult to make a decision when everybody has their own specific design of the robot. I do not have much experience in building robots specifically, but I did “dabble” in the python software program, and I know some things about hardware. </p>

                <p class="personBio">Chapter One: I am Henry. I am a sophomore at CHS. I am currently 15 years old. I spent majority of my childhood in China and moved to the United States in 2004 as my parents found jobs overseas. I had no friends back then so everything was fine with me. I still had to learn English, though, which sucked. My first friend was the children’s dictionary. Chapter Two: I’ve been interested in robotics ever since I got my hands on the Rock ‘em Sock ‘em (The most fun you can have with your clothes on - Jingles 2013)game thingy. I was interested in how the “robots” worked, and eventually took it apart. However, I had no idea what the parts were for nor how to put it back together. But it seemed interesting, and that was all it took to spark my interest. I didn’t touch robotics for a long time before joining the club, however, as I found more interest in software.

I like playing basketball and video games.

We fight and we win, gracefully, nothing else said matters. And I just want some place to be for 2 hours where I won’t be bored. I have experience when it comes to building things, anything. Since I was 9, I have been building things out of whatever I could find, I’ve made scale models out of paper, sheet metal, or any useful scraps. I have the ability to improvise and still make things work. I can design things that actually WORK, due to my extensive experience with my grandparents, who design and build bombers. What makes me, me? Well, I make myself myself and only myself, for only I can make myself myself and myself cannot be made by anything other than myself. </p>

Majorly due to these acquaintances, I decided to join the FTC Robotics teams at Cupertino High School. In team 4950, I’ve gotten to know many different people. I’ve been motivated not only to learn more in robotics, but to learn all that I can. Robotics has been a wonderful experience for me. Throughout my life, I believe I have developed into a curious, perseverant, and hardworking young man. These traits are what characterize me, and I hope that robotics will pose a challenge that will allow me to exercise these traits and teach me what I have always wanted to learn.

I joined CHS Robotics 2015-2016 to expand my knowledge and also because creating a robot interests me. I am currently on the software division of 4950, trying to figure out how stuff works and is put together ( but I also help out on the hardware side too…). I have experience in computer programming languages such as Python, C , C++ and a little bit of Java too. ( Note: I am NOT an expert at all these languages…). I think that my family and friends greatly shape me as a person and I owe a lot to my family who make me who I am today.

Robotics is something that is very new and exciting for me. Overall, team 4950 has been awesome and learning robotics is very fun. I have learned a lot more than I had expected and as a team we have accomplished a lot and made many crucial breakthroughs. We have grown as a team and are ready to take down any challenges first presents us.</p>
